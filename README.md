# PMS-std-crud-backend

Welcome to the PMS-std-crud-backend repository! This project implements a Placement Management System (PMS) with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Spring Boot. The system is designed to efficiently manage placement-related data, providing enhanced usability for users.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Fully functional endpoints for managing placement data, including:
  - Create new placement records
  - Read existing records
  - Update records as needed
  - Delete records when necessary

- **Efficient Data Management**: Ensures smooth handling of placement-related information for users.

## Tech Stack

- **Spring Boot**: For building the RESTful API and managing backend logic.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For database interactions and repository management.
- **MySQL**: As the database for storing placement data.
- **Java**: As the primary programming language.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- JDK 11 or higher
- Maven
- MySQL Server

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PMS-std-crud-backend.git
   cd PMS-std-crud-backend
   ```

2. **Set up MySQL Database**:
   - Create a new database (e.g., `placement_management`).
   - Update the `application.properties` file in `src/main/resources` with your database credentials.

3. **Build the Application**:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

5. **Access the API**:
   Open a tool like Postman to test the endpoints at `http://localhost:8080/api/placements`.

### API Endpoints

- **Create Placement**: `POST /api/placements`
- **Get All Placements**: `GET /api/placements`
- **Get Placement by ID**: `GET /api/placements/{id}`
- **Update Placement**: `PUT /api/placements/{id}`
- **Delete Placement**: `DELETE /api/placements/{id}`
